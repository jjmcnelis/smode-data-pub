# wireframes

This folder stores and version controls content related to S-MODE/PO.DAAC collaboration on dataset wireframes.

**How I intend to use this folder and its content:**

Whenever Susannah makes substantial changes to the wireframes, I'll run the Python script in this directory to:

* sync the new wireframes to this directory, 
* dump the CDL representation of each one to an adjacent text file, and 
* do preliminary validation for critical file metadata, structure requirements.

**Links:**

* Susannah's latest *DummyFiles* on Dropbox:
  * https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bxsiert5zl1rmpd/AACgS4dVWXSf3j0jUQBVky6aa?dl=0
  * *Replace trailing `0` with `1` to trigger zip+download service on Dropbox side.*
