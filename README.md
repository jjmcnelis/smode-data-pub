# smode-data-pub

For support of the Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment (S-MODE).

**Things to know:**

* Items related to project implementation and archive procedure planning processes are in `docs`.
* Machine-readable references to project data/metadata are in `references`.
* The `gcmd` directory is a submodule linked to a repository that I maintain on my public github account. It syncs GCMD resources organized for me to conveniently access.

A simple, dedicated code base for translating S-MODE raw data outputs into archive-ready data files will be developed and maintained here.
