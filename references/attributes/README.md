# attribute_reference

This retains versions of the dataset attributes table that Fred and I have iterated on with feedback from corresponding investigators for each product.

Fred's first mark up: [attribute-reference/attribute-reference_FB.xlsx](attribute_reference/attribute-reference_FB.xlsx). The later versions I renamed to match this sequence:

>`attribute-reference_#_#.xlsx`

where first and second `#` are the major and minor versions, respectively.
