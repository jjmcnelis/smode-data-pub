# project-reference/

This folder stores static references to important info that isn't dynamic throughout the project. These tables may reference each other like relational tables according to some index that I find useful when developing the archive production routines.

For instance, the core group of investigators wont change. Some non-sensitive data about each of them are given in [`people.csv`](people.csv).

## Contents

* [`attributes/`](attributes/): copies of iterated attribute tables developed through collaboration by Jack, Fred, and Science Team,
* [`people.csv`](people.csv): data about the S-MODE investigators (no PII),
* [`instruments.csv`](instruments.csv): data about the S-MODE suite of instruments,
